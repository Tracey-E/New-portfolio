        <p>
          I started coding in June 2021. I am self-taught but have been on a
          bootcamp for web development. During my time on the bootcamp I was
          able to not only work with other members as a team but also offer my
          free time to help them to complete given assignments or helping them to  understand the
          concepts of the lessons more. I have been working on my own projects
          for the past 11 months. In this time I have created a full stack
          e-commerce website that used a SQL database, plus several smaller
          projects. all links to the projects are on the
          <a href="projects.html" target="_blank"> <i>Projects page,</i></a>
          all though I am more comfortable with front end development. I am also
          currently volunteering as a web development officer for a charity where I
          am helping them to re-create their website.
