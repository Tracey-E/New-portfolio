                    <p>  I live in Yorkshire, UK. I started coding in June 2021. My main ambition is to develop my own websites, as well as to develop my own game.
                             There is one part of coding I find frustrating, this is when I come across an error that I currently do not understand how to fix. (google is my best friend in these situations).
                        Within this portfolio I will be showing some of the projects that I have completed during my learning at Codecademy plus projects I am building on my own initiative in my free time.
